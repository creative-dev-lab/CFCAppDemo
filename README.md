# CFCAppDemo (Or Carbon Footprint Calculator app demo)

This is a demo mobile application written in SwiftUI in which the user can select an origin and a destination airport, and calculate the carbon footprint of taking a flight between the selected airport.

##  üîß Environment
![<iOS>-<iOS 16.2 and later>](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-iOS%2016.2%20and%20later-brightgreen)  
![<Xcode>-<Xcode 14.2>](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-Xcode%2014.2-blue)  
![<Swift>-<Swift 5>](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-Swift%205-informational)  

##  üì≤ Prerequisites
In this demo, we took the approach to secure the secrets in the easiest, yet quite effective Apple‚Äôs way, using `.plist` file.

You are going to need your [toohla](https://www.toohla.com/) api-key, which is used to get the flight offset data from their web services.

Once you get the API Key from `toohla`, please follow the below steps to secure the api key.

### Step 1
Add a `plist` file at the root level of this project, and name it as you want.

In this demo, it is supposed to be `API_KEY`.

### Step 2
Add your api key to the added `API_KEY.plist` file.

üéâüéâüéâ You are now all set.



##  ‚úàÔ∏è üè® Key Components and Design Decisions

It consists of 3 pages total, i.e. Main page, the flight search screen for `From-Location` and the `To-Destination`, and the flight offset show-off page.

* Basic UI/UX Design Using SwiftUI Components
* Demonstration of the simple navigation using `NavigationView` and `NavigationStack`
* Demonstration of the custom search text field and the list
* Demonstration of How to throttle search (based on typing speed)
* Demonstration of using color sets for the light/dark appearance
* Demonstration of using ViewModel - (expandable to MVVM design pattern)
* Demonstration of custom API client using `URLRequest`
* Demonstration of securing API Key by using `.plist` file
